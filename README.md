This project is my Dissertation for my Masters degree from Durham University, Applications do not work without the required models.

This project delved into the realm of image classification asking the questions which models can classify with localisation effectivley 6 models from 3 main architectures were trained and the training script can be found in the repo.

The dataset used for all training was the publically available NIH dataset ! a comprehenisve powerful data source for training Deep learning classification models for Chest X-ray pathology detection.

The project achieved 75% mark. I hope you enjoy reading it !

Many thanks,
Joe.
